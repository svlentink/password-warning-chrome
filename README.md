# password warning in Chrome for non-secure websites

Coders understand that entering a password without encryption
isn't a good thing when on public wifi,

Please install this chrome extension on the laptop of someone you care about.
Feel free to read the code, this README contains more characters than the actual code.

Also consider to change this setting in chrome: chrome://flags/#mark-non-secure-as
